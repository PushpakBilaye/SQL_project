# SQL_project
I have made SQL project named "Society_management_system". In this project I have taken dummy data. I have used XAMPP for performing sql queries. We can change/update/delete data with the help of queries or commands in sql.
With the help of this document you can see different queries eg. related to joins, subqueries, view, etc. ER diagram helps you to understand connections between all tables of database.
